# File_upload_system_nodejs-cloudinary-formidable


## Introduction

In this project, I created a simple file upload system using NodeJS and Cloudinary cloud service. This is a very simple way to handle either single or mulitiple file uploads using NodeJS. I choosed cloudinary as a data storage platform instead of the local storage because of space complexity. I know it will be much better if the files are being stored in an external storage preferably the cloud so as to reduce the amount of storage consumption of the project and to improve the load time of the application. Download/Clone this repo to use this code.
